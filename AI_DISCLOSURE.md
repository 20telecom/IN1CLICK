# AI Disclosure

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools, including:

- Claude
- GitHub Copilot
- OpenAI Codex
- OpenAI ChatGPT

These tools were used in an interactive, assistive capacity only.

No autonomous or agent-based workflows were used to independently generate, modify, or commit code to this repository.

All final code and documentation have been reviewed, tested, and validated by the project maintainers. We fully understand and take responsibility for the implementation.
